# Moodcake Font Installation Instructions

## Steps to complete the font implementation:

1. Place the font files you have in this directory:
   - moodcake.otf (OpenType format)
   - moodcake.ttf (TrueType format)

2. Make sure the filenames match exactly as written above, or rename the files to match these names.

3. The CSS and configuration files have already been updated to use both .otf and .ttf formats.

4. After placing the font files in this directory, your application will automatically use the Moodcake font.

5. If you encounter any issues with the font display:
   - Make sure the font filenames match exactly what's referenced in fonts.css
   - Try clearing your browser cache
   - Check browser console for any font loading errors
