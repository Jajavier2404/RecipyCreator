# Moodcake Font Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Font Configuration:**
   - Added Moodcake font to the project
   - Updated `fonts.css` to include Moodcake font face definition
   - Modified font-baloo class to use Moodcake as primary font
   - Added font-moodcake class for direct use of the Moodcake font

2. **Tailwind Configuration:**
   - Updated tailwind.config.js to include Moodcake in the font families
   - Added 'moodcake' font family for use with Tailwind classes
   - Modified 'baloo' font family to use Moodcake as primary font

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the existing classes
All elements previously using the font-baloo class will now use Moodcake automatically.

```jsx
<h1 className="font-baloo">This will now use Moodcake</h1>
```

### Option 2: Use the new font-moodcake class
For explicit use of Moodcake:

```jsx
<h1 className="font-moodcake">This uses Moodcake</h1>
```

### Option 3: Use Tailwind utility classes
With Tailwind:

```jsx
<h1 className="font-moodcake">Moodcake with Tailwind</h1>
```

## Required Files

Before running the application, make sure to:
1. Download the Moodcake font files
2. Place them in the `/public/fonts/` directory with these names:
   - moodcake.ttf
   - moodcake.woff
   - moodcake.woff2 (if available)

See MOODCAKE_INSTRUCTIONS.md in the fonts directory for detailed instructions.

## Example Component

A demo component has been created at `/src/components/MoodcakeDemoComponent.jsx` 
showing both ways to use the Moodcake font.
